# Number-Plate-Game-Solver
A python program that gives solutions to the number plate game. 

**Rules:** In the number plate game players have to make a word containing the last three letters of a car number plate in the order they are printed. The letters must not be directly next to one another in the word. If there are multiple instances of a letter in the word, the word is allowed if at least once combination of the three letters is valid. For examples, see the image below.
